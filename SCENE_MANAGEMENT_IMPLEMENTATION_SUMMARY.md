## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Complete Game Loop Management**
```csharp
// Full cycle: Menu → Power Selection → Match → Post-Match → Rematch/Return
public enum GameState
{
    Menu, PowerSelection, MatchSetup, MatchActive, MatchEnded, PostMatch
}
```

### 2. **Advanced Scene Transition System**
```csharp
// Smooth transitions with fade effects and loading screens
public void LoadScene(string sceneName, GameState targetState = GameState.Menu)
{
    // Includes: fade out → loading screen → async load → initialize → fade in
}
```

### 3. **Persistent Player Data**
```csharp
// Comprehensive player settings and statistics
public class PersistentPlayerSettings
{
    // Player preferences, audio settings, match statistics
    public void SaveToPlayerPrefs() { /* Automatic persistence */ }
    public void LoadFromPlayerPrefs() { /* Restore on game start */ }
}
```

### 4. **Error Handling and Recovery**
```csharp
// Graceful handling of match errors and timeouts
public void HandleMatchError(string errorMessage)
{
    // Mark match as unclean, disable rematch, auto-return to menu
}
```

### 5. **Match Result Processing**
```csharp
// Complete match data tracking and post-match flow
public void OnMatchEnd(MatchResult result)
{
    // Update stats → show post-match UI → enable rematch/return options
}
```

### 6. **Safety and Edge Case Handling**
- **Multiple Load Prevention**: Prevents simultaneous scene loading
- **Match Timeout**: Automatic timeout after 10 minutes
- **Clean Match Validation**: Only allows rematch if match completed properly
- **Auto-Recovery**: Returns to menu on critical errors

## 🎯 Integration Points

### With Existing Systems

#### MainMenuUI Integration
```csharp
// Seamless transition from menu to game
mainMenuUI.OnPlayPressed() → gameManager.StartNewGame() → Power Selection
```

#### PowerSelectionManager Integration
```csharp
// Automatic progression to match when selections complete
powerSelectionManager.OnMatchStartRequested → gameManager.SetGameState(MatchSetup)
```

#### MatchManager Integration
```csharp
// Match completion triggers post-match flow
matchManager.OnMatchEnded → gameManager.OnMatchEnd() → PostMatchUI display
```

#### PostMatchUI Integration
```csharp
// User choices trigger appropriate actions
rematchButton → gameManager.OnRematchPressed() → return to match
menuButton → gameManager.OnReturnToMenuPressed() → return to menu
```

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### Basic Game Flow
1. **Start**: Game opens in MainMenu scene with MenuState
2. **Play**: User presses Play → transitions to PowerSelection state
3. **Select**: Users choose superpowers → transitions to MatchSetup state
4. **Match**: Gameplay occurs in MatchActive state
5. **End**: Match ends → transitions to PostMatch state
6. **Choice**: User chooses Rematch (→ MatchSetup) or Return (→ Menu)

### Developer Usage
```csharp
// Start new game
gameManager.StartNewGame(multiplayer: false);

// Handle match completion
var result = new MatchResult(won: true, playerScore: 3, opponentScore: 1, ...);
gameManager.OnMatchEnd(result);

// Save player preferences
gameManager.SavePlayerPrefs();
```

### Testing the System
```csharp
// Use CompleteGameLoopDemo for comprehensive testing
var demo = FindObjectOfType<CompleteGameLoopDemo>();
demo.StartDemo(); // Runs complete automated test cycle
```
