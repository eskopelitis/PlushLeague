- **ScriptableObject-based superpower data** for easy designer control
- **Modular effect system** with abstract base classes  
- **Complete UI integration** with selection, cooldowns, and feedback
- **Field effect management** for area-of-effect powers
- **Networking-ready architecture** with sync hooks
- **Mobile-first controls** with touch and keyboard input

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### 1. Modular Superpower Effects
```csharp
// Example: Creating a new superpower effect
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "NewEffect", menuName = "Plush League/Superpower Effects/New Effect")]
public class NewSuperpowerEffect : SuperpowerEffect
{
    public override void Execute(PlayerController owner, BallController ball, SuperpowerUIManager uiManager)
    {
        // Implement your superpower logic here
    }
}
```

### 2. Player Integration
```csharp
// Superpower activation in PlayerController
public void ActivateSuperpower()
{
    if (!IsSuperpowerReady) return;
    equippedSuperpower.powerEffect.Execute(this, ballController, superpowerUI);
    StartSuperpowerCooldown();
}
```

### 3. Ball Effect Handling
```csharp
// Enhanced ball controller with superpower effects
public void ApplySuperShot(Vector3 direction, float force)
{
    ForceDetach();
    rb.AddForce(direction.normalized * force, ForceMode.Impulse);
    // Enhanced visual trail and effects
}
```

### 4. Field Effect System
```csharp
// Create temporary field effects
SuperpowerManager.Instance.CreateFieldEffect(
    FieldEffectType.FreezeZone, 
    position, 
    duration, 
    radius
);
```
